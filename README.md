a remake of the Atari ST's hit Tempest using plain old Blitz Basic (BlitzMax)

a built binary (800x600 windowed) is included with the repo, might need DirectX 7
it's from the 2005 era, found in an old Sata drive full of sharewares and [Login] Magazine (the post Amiga Dream magazine) snippets

just pushed out of nostalgia, and to read the code. i will never teach BASIC to my kids.
